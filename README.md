# Thyroid_cancer_risk_data



## Overview
The thyroid cancer risk dataset contains demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and diagnostic data for a diverse population of patients. Key attributes include age, gender, country, and ethnicity, along with family history, radiation exposure, iodine deficiency, smoking, obesity, and diabetes as potential risk indicators. The dataset also includes clinical measures like TSH, T3, and T4 hormone levels and nodule size, which are essential for understanding thyroid health. The target variables are Thyroid_Cancer_Risk (categorized into low, medium, and high) and Diagnosis (benign or malignant). This rich dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for identifying critical factors contributing to thyroid cancer and enables data-driven insights for risk prediction, early detection, and targeted medical intervention.


## Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle, and also available on my profile.

Columns: The dataset includes key columns such as Age, Gender, Family_History, Radiation_Exposure, Iodine_Deficiency, and Nodule_Size, which are critical in assessing thyroid cancer risk. It also features TSH, T3, and T4 hormone levels along with Thyroid_Cancer_Risk and Diagnosis, providing both predictive and outcome variables essential for medical analysis.
## Insights
1.Thyroid Cancer Risk by Ethnicity
Variables: Ethnicity, Thyroid_Cancer_Risk
Visualization: Grouped Bar Chart
Explanation: The Caucasian group shows the highest counts across all cancer risk levels, especially for low and medium risk. Asians have a notable number of high-risk cases compared to other ethnicities, while Middle Eastern individuals have the lowest overall counts across risk levels.

2. Symptoms Contribution to High Thyroid Cancer Risk
Variables: Family History, Radiation Exposure, Iodine Deficiency, Smoking, Obesity, Diabetes
Visualization: Transposed Grouped Mean Table
Explanation: Family history and radiation exposure are the most influential factors among individuals with a high risk of thyroid cancer. Obesity and iodine deficiency also show moderate contributions, while smoking and diabetes have comparatively lower association.

3. Product Category Popularity
Variables: Category, Purchase Amount (USD)
Visualization: Count Plot / Pie Chart
Explanation: Clothing, Home Decor, and Electronics are the most popular product categories. These categories dominate both in terms of purchase frequency and overall revenue, making them crucial for inventory and marketing focus.

## Key insights
The dataset reveals that individuals with a family history of thyroid issues and iodine deficiency are more likely to be at high risk for thyroid cancer. Females and elderly individuals, particularly those above 70, show a higher prevalence of high-risk classification. Additionally, countries like India and China report the highest number of cases, with India showing a notable count of malignant diagnoses, highlighting geographical disparities in thyroid cancer occurrence.
